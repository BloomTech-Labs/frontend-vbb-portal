                  <p>Village Book Builders (“Non-Profit”) owns and operates a not-for-profit
                  organization which arranges for mentoring (“mentoring”) of school
                  children by volunteer Volunteers. By signing up to provide mentoring, you
                  (“Volunteer”) are entering into a binding agreement with Non-Profit and
                  agree to terms and conditions herein.</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, Volunteer desires to provide mentoring services as arranged by
                  Non-Profit, and will gain and benefit from being provided such mentoring
                  opportunities; and WHEREAS, the parties desire to specify the terms
                  under which such mentoring shall be provided;</p>
                  <p>NOW THEREFORE, in consideration below describe covenants and promises
                  between the parties, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
                  acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Mentoring. Volunteer shall provide mentoring services as assigned by
                    Non-Profit, subject to the terms and requirements of this agreement.
                    Volunteer acknowledges and agrees that it shall receive no compensation
                    of any kind for any mentoring provided under this agreement, and
                    Volunteer covenants that it shall not pursue compensation of any kind
                    from the mentored student of the family of the mentored student.
                    Volunteer agrees with Non-Profit that the education, skill and
                    experience constitute compensation sufficient to warrant consideration
                    between the parties.</li>
                    <li>Standards of Conduct. Volunteer shall maintain the highest standard of
                    conduct in all interactions with students, other volunteers and teachers,
                    and any other person they come into contact with while serving as a
                    volunteer with Non-Profit. Volunteer shall not discuss, display, or
                    portray lewd,indecent or inappropriate subject, images, or pictures at
                    any time. Volunteer shall respect the individuality and privacy of all
                    mentored students, and shall treat such students with the highest
                    respect.</li>
                  <li>Termination. Non-Profit retains the right to terminate the services of
                  Volunteer at any time for any reason or no reason whatsoever. This
                  contract constitutes a right to work contract and can be terminated by
                  either party at any time and for reason. In the event of any breach of
                  this Agreement byVolunteer, this Agreement shall be automatically
                  terminated unless Non-Profit notifies Volunteer that theAgreement is
                  still in force and effect.</li>
                  <li>Confidentiality. In the course of providing mentoring services,
                  Volunteer may acquire confidential information from Non-Profit or from
                  mentored students and/or their families. Confidential information
                  includes, but is not limited to, all lists, data or information of any
                  kind pertaining to Non-Profit or mentored students which is not, at the
                  time it is acquired, generally available to the public.Volunteer shall
                  not at any time reveal or use in any fashion such confidential
                  information without the prior express permission of the party who owns
                  the information. This provision shall continue in full force and effect
                  after Volunteer ceases to provide mentoring services for Non-Profit.
                  Volunteer acknowledges that damages which Non-Profit may suffer from a
                  breach of this paragraph are difficult or impossible to determine, but in
                  no way is such information valued at less than Five Hundred and 00/100
                  Dollars ($500.00). This amount constitutes a specified amount of minimum
                  damages between the parties and not liquidated damages. In addition,
                  Non-Profit may obtain injunctive relief to prevent Volunteer from further
                  dissemination of confidential information. If Non-Profit is required to
                  take legal action against Volunteer as a result of a breach of any of the
                  covenants contained in this paragraph 4 or any other clause contained
                  within this employment contract, he or she will be responsible for the
                  reasonable attorney's fees accumulated as a result of said breach.</li>
                  <li>Indemnification. Each party shall indemnify and holt the other party
                  and its offices, agents, and employees harmless from and against all
                  liabilities, damages, losses, actions, or causes of action, costs and
                  expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees if related to the
                  provision of mentoring services byVolunteer in this agreement, as well
                  as any claims related to personal injury or death arising out of or
                  in any way contributed to by the acts or failure to act of the other
                  party, its agents, employees, officers or assigns, including, but not
                  limited to, the careless, reckless, negligent, wanton or willful conduct
                  ofVolunteer. Volunteer is responsible to obtain and maintain its own
