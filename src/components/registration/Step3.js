            <p>Village Book Builders (“Non-Profit”) owns and operates a not-for-profit
            organization which arranges for mentoring (“mentoring”) of school
            children by volunteer Volunteers. By signing up to provide mentoring, you
            (“Volunteer”) are entering into a binding agreement with Non-Profit and
            agree to terms and conditions herein.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS, Volunteer desires to provide mentoring services as arranged by
            Non-Profit, and will gain and benefit from being provided such mentoring
            opportunities; and WHEREAS, the parties desire to specify the terms
            under which such mentoring shall be provided;</p>

            <p>NOW THEREFORE, in consideration below describe covenants and promises
            between the parties, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
            acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:</p>

            <ol>

              <li>Mentoring. Volunteer shall provide mentoring services as assigned by
              Non-Profit, subject to the terms and requirements of this agreement.
              Volunteer acknowledges and agrees that it shall receive no compensation
              of any kind for any mentoring provided under this agreement, and
              Volunteer covenants that it shall not pursue compensation of any kind
              from the mentored student of the family of the mentored student.
              Volunteer agrees with Non-Profit that the education, skill and
              experience constitute compensation sufficient to warrant consideration
              between the parties.</li>

              <li>Standards of Conduct. Volunteer shall maintain the highest standard of
              conduct in all interactions with students, other volunteers and teachers,
              and any other person they come into contact with while serving as a
              volunteer with Non-Profit. Volunteer shall not discuss, display, or
              portray lewd,indecent or inappropriate subject, images, or pictures at
              any time. Volunteer shall respect the individuality and privacy of all
              mentored students, and shall treat such students with the highest
              respect.</li>

            <li>Termination. Non-Profit retains the right to terminate the services of
            Volunteer at any time for any reason or no reason whatsoever. This
            contract constitutes a right to work contract and can be terminated by
            either party at any time and for reason. In the event of any breach of
            this Agreement byVolunteer, this Agreement shall be automatically
            terminated unless Non-Profit notifies Volunteer that theAgreement is
            still in force and effect.</li>

            <li>Confidentiality. In the course of providing mentoring services,
            Volunteer may acquire confidential information from Non-Profit or from
            mentored students and/or their families. Confidential information
            includes, but is not limited to, all lists, data or information of any
            kind pertaining to Non-Profit or mentored students which is not, at the
            time it is acquired, generally available to the public.Volunteer shall
            not at any time reveal or use in any fashion such confidential
            information without the prior express permission of the party who owns
            the information. This provision shall continue in full force and effect
            after Volunteer ceases to provide mentoring services for Non-Profit.
            Volunteer acknowledges that damages which Non-Profit may suffer from a
            breach of this paragraph are difficult or impossible to determine, but in
            no way is such information valued at less than Five Hundred and 00/100
            Dollars ($500.00). This amount constitutes a specified amount of minimum
            damages between the parties and not liquidated damages. In addition,
            Non-Profit may obtain injunctive relief to prevent Volunteer from further
            dissemination of confidential information. If Non-Profit is required to
            take legal action against Volunteer as a result of a breach of any of the
            covenants contained in this paragraph 4 or any other clause contained
            within this employment contract, he or she will be responsible for the
            reasonable attorney's fees accumulated as a result of said breach.</li>

            <li>Indemnification. Each party shall indemnify and holt the other party
            and its offices, agents, and employees harmless from and against all
            liabilities, damages, losses, actions, or causes of action, costs and
            expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees if related to the
            provision of mentoring services byVolunteer in this agreement, as well
            as any claims related to personal injury or death arising out of or
            in any way contributed to by the acts or failure to act of the other
            party, its agents, employees, officers or assigns, including, but not
            limited to, the careless, reckless, negligent, wanton or willful conduct
            ofVolunteer. Volunteer is responsible to obtain and maintain its own
            insurance, and no insurance will be provided by Non-Profit. Non-Profit
            shall not be liable for any acts of Volunteer, regardless of the
            nature of those acts, the only exception being if such acts by Volunteer
            were part of the day to day activities of his or her job with Non Profit
            and no negligence nor intentional conduct on the part of
            Volunteer occurred.</li>

            <li>Volunteer. Volunteer understands that, as a volunteer, Volunteer will
            receive no compensation or remuneration for services and will not be
            eligible for any employee benefits. Volunteer acknowledges that they are
            not an employee.</li>

            <li>Intellectual Property. Volunteer hereby irrevocably permits,
            authorizes, grants, and licenses toNon-Profit and its affiliates,
            successors, and assigns, and their respective licensees, and the
            employees,officers, directors, and agents of each and all of them
            (“Authorized Persons”):</li>

            <ul>

              otherwise use, and permit others to use my name, image, likeness, and all
              materials created by or on behalf of Non-Profit that incorporate any of
              the foregoing (“Materials”) in perpetuity throughout the universe in any

                agrees that Volunteer has no right to review or approve Materials before
                they are used by Non-Profit, and that Non-Profit has no liability to me
                for any editing or alteration of the Materials or for any distortion or
                other effects resulting from Non-Profit’s editing, alteration, or use of
                the Materials, or Non-Profit’s presentation of me. Any credit or other
                acknowledgment of me, if any,shall be determined by Non-Profit in
                Non-Profit’s sole discretion. Non-Profit has no obligation to create or
                use the Materials or to exercise any rights given by this Agreement.</p>

                <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, Volunteer hereby irrevocably
                waives all legal and equitable rights relating to all
                liabilities,claims, demands, actions, suits, damages, and expenses,
                including but not limited to claims for infringement, libel, defamation,

                under this Agreement or the use of the Materials, and whether resulting
                by the negligence of Non-Profit or any other person, covenant not to
                make or bring any suchClaim against any Authorized Persons, and forever
                release and discharge the Authorized Persons from liability under such
                Claims. Volunteer understands Non-Profit is relying on this Agreement
                and will incur significant expense in its reliance, and Volunteer agrees
                that this Agreement cannot be terminated,rescinded, or modified, in
                whole or in part.</p>
