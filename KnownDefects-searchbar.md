# Search Bar Known Defects

### SearchbarAutoComplete.js
    - Edit button is not fully functional yet, need to have a form connected to the button 
    - Need to connect with back end and have a PUT request for Edit button, this endpoint requires an external id
    - Once backend is ready and seeded, use the searchbarAPI to make requests to the backend
    - Should use the SearchbarAPI.js that is imported already

### SearchbarAPI.js
    - All API calls are console logged 
    - The response is not doing anything yet
    - There are rquests for mentees with endpoints that don't exist yet. These are commented within the file.

### StudentInfo.js
    - Some of the inputs are commented out until its clearer what info is needed to be edited.
